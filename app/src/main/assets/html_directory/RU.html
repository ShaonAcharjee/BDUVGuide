            The University of Rajshahi, also known as Rajshahi University or RU is a public university which is the second largest university in Bangladesh, in Rajshahi, a city in northwestern Bangladesh. It was established in 1953, the second university to be established in what was then East Pakistan. The university is ranked third on the Bangladesh University Ranking 2017.</br></br>

            The university's 58 departments are organised into ten faculties. Rajshahi University is in a 753 acres (3 km2) campus in Motihar, 3 kilometres (2 mi) from the Rajshahi city centre. With 25,000 students and close to 1000 academic staff, it is one of the largest universities in Bangladesh. In addition to hosting programs in engineering, arts, law, sciences, agriculture, social sciences, business studies and medical sciences, the university houses institutes of higher studies.</br></br>

            History</br></br>

            The description on the memorial says, "Rajshahi University: Those who were martyred during the Liberation war".</br></br>
            The first proposal to establish a university came in 1917, when Calcutta University created the Sadler Commission[citation needed] to assess the university system in Bengal. However, the recommendations of the report had no immediate consequences.</br></br>

            Following the Partition of India in 1947, what is now Bangladesh became East Pakistan. University of Dhaka, established in 1921, was the only university in East Pakistan at the time. Demand for a university in the northern part of East Pakistan gained momentum when two universities were established in West Pakistan without the establishment of any in the east. Students of Rajshahi College were at the forefront of the movement demanding a new university. Finally, Rajshahi was selected as the home for the second university in East Pakistan and the Rajshahi University Act of 1953 (East Bengal Act XV of 1953) was passed by the East Pakistan provincial Assembly on 31 March 1953. Itrat Hossain Zuberi, the principal of Rajshahi College was appointed its first vice-chancellor.</br></br>

            Initially, the university was housed in temporary locations, such as the local Circuit House and Bara Kuthi, an 18th-century Dutch establishment. B B Hindu Academy, a local school, housed the library, teachers' lounge and the medical centre. The university started out with 20 professors, 161 students (of which 5 were female) and six departments—Bengali, English, History, Law, Philosophy and Economics. In 1964, the offices moved to the permanent campus.</br></br>

            The 1960s was a turbulent period in Bangladesh, when demands for East Pakistani autonomy became stronger. The students and staff of the university started playing an increasing role in politics. On 18 February 1969, Shamsuzzoha, a professor, was killed by the police when he tried to prevent them from shooting student demonstrators. This date is now commemorated as Zoha Day.During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, the campus was used as a base by the Pakistan Army. A number of professors, students and officers of the university were killed by the Pakistan army during this period.</br></br>

            After independence, a new act regarding the administration of the university came into being—the Rajshahi University Act of 1973. The post-independence years saw the university grow steadily in student enrolment and size of the academic staff. However, the 1980s were turbulent for the university, as the students agitated with other institutions of the country against the military rule of Hossain Muhammad Ershad. Since the early 1990s, the university have seen relative calm and lowering of session backlogs, though active student politics remains a contentious issue.</br></br>

            The Teacher Students Center was designed to be the centre of cultural activities of the university. Reception of fresh students, celebration of national holidays, and the annual cultural competition are key cultural events at the campus.The university is home to recitation groups like Shwanan, and drama groups like Anushilon and Rajshahi University Drama Association (RUDA). A vibrant fine arts scene thrives around the Department of Fine Arts, and the campus hosts exhibitions each year.

On these days, students and teachers, going barefoot, congregate around the Shaheed Minar and pay their respect. During the major Muslim religious occasions of Eid, the university is usually deserted as students go home to be with their families. Other religiously important days like Shabe-barat are observed through discussions and religious activities. The major Hindu festival celebrated in the university is Saraswati Puja—Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, is worshiped in a central location as well as individually in many residential halls.[citation needed] The Bengali new year, Pohela Baisakh is also observed with much pomp.</br></br>

            Main campus</br></br>
            Front view of the Administration Building of Rajshahi University.</br></br>
            The university's main campus is in Motihar, on the eastern side of the city of Rajshahi and a mile from the river Padma. The campus area is nearly 753 acres (3.05 km2). Access to the walled-off campus is controlled through three security gates. It houses eleven large academic buildings—five for the arts, business studies and social sciences, four for the sciences and two for agricultural studies.</br></br>

            The central part of the university, accessible by the main gate, is dominated by the administrative building, where the offices of the vice-chancellor and other officials are located. This is flanked by the senate building and the residence of the vice-chancellor on one side (featuring the famous Shabash Bangladesh sculpture) and the university mosque and Shaheed Minar complex on the other. Behind the administrative building is the central library, around which the four science buildings and three main arts buildings are. The science buildings are named numerically as the "First Science Building" and so on. The arts buildings are named after Muhammad Shahidullah, Momtazuddin Ahmed and Rabindranath Tagore. More towards the east lie the stadium, the new teacher-student centre and the main auditorium.</br></br>

            The Kazla gate provides access to the southwestern part of the campus. The Juberi international guest house, Rajshahi University School and the main residential facilities for the academic staff and university officers are here. Near the residential areas are all five dorms (known as residential halls) for female students. The eastern part of the campus houses the Institute of Bangladesh Studies, the medical and sports facilities, and more residential facilities for the staff—but is dominated by the eleven large dormitories for male students. From the Binodpur gate, the residential halls named after Nawab Abdul Latif, Shamsuzzoha and Madarbux are to the north, while Sher-e-Bangla hall and the oldest dorm Motihar Hall lie to the west. The second largest mass graves in Bangladesh from the 1971 war era is behind Shamsuzzoha Hall.</br></br>

            The campus contains many mango orchards and some litchi trees. The Paris Road is one of the most soothing places inside the campus. It starts from just behind the Juberi international guest house and ends in front of the Shaheed Minar. It has been said that it has been named as Paris Road because of the trees beside this beautiful road originating from Paris.</br></br>

            The Rajshahi area is regarded as one of the best mango producing areas in the country, and these orchards are leased out to professional farmers during the summer, when the fruits grow. The campus also reflects the region's silk industry, fields of mulberry trees are in the campus for agricultural and research needs. The northern part of the campus houses a botanical garden, which has a good collection of rare plants.</br></br>



            Other facilities</br></br>

            Varendra Museum is the oldest in the nation and an important resource for the university</br></br>
            A few miles from the main campus is the Varendra Research Museum, one of the richest repertory of Bengal sculptures in the world. Established in 1910 by Ramaprasad Chanda, the museum became a part of the university in 1960s when a financial crisis threatened its existence. Under the university, the museum has thrived, adding an folklore gallery to its impressive collection from ancient and medieval Bengal.</br></br>

            The Bara Kuthi, where the university was established is still under university control, and is on the Padma not too far from Varendra Museum. The university has an agricultural facility few miles from the main campus. Rajshahi University maintains other facilities across the country including a guesthouse in the capital city, Dhaka.</br></br>
