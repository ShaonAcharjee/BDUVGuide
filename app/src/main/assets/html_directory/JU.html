            Established in 1985, the JU library is equipped with a huge collection of books. Located behind a monument of "Sangshaptak", the library is conveniently placed between the main academic buildings and the dormitories. The entire area has Wi-Fi coverage. There are more than 110,000 books, 14,000 hardbound journals, and 22,000 online journals in the library. The library can accommodate over 170 students at a time. There is a cyber centre on the premises. Airy with ample glass openings, the library is an elegant piece of architecture.</br></br>


            Obtaining and cancelling a library membership involves a fair number of steps. The library administration plans to extend the library buildings and make the whole system computerised, to make it easier to lend books. The library's design used to be more spacious than it currently is. But the authority did not complete its entire structure. This results in students facing problems when using the library, especially since the university is residential.</br></br>
